      "message": "One of my comments seems to have been lost and stray text added instead. Retrying...\n\nI\u0027m worried that with the os.Rename trick, upsync-* partial files will be left in the local tree and copied up to the server at the next run of upsync. That can be cleaned up manually, but it is a mess especially if more than one client machine is using upsync.\n\nAnyway, I haven\u0027t observed the partial downloads that you\u0027re trying to fix with this trick. Maybe that is because I run cacheserver and you don\u0027t? Any other ideas why we see different behavior?",
