      "message": "Hi Eric,\n\nI use upsync to backup my upspin data. When I first listed my files after pulling them I thought upsync resets their modtime to the current time. Obviously it doesn\u0027t, but I just happen to have had a bunch of directories in the top level.\n\nThis change matches the local directory timestamps to match the upspin ones, to save folks like me the initial surprise.",
